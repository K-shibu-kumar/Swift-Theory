///# MVC

///*MVC (Model-View-Controller) is a software architectural pattern commonly used in Swift and other programming languages to separate the concerns of an application into three distinct components: Model, View, and Controller. Each component has a specific role and responsibilities, making the code more organized, maintainable, and easier to understand.

///#Model:
///*The Model represents the data and business logic of the application. It is responsible for managing the application's data and state. In Swift, the Model is typically implemented using classes or structs. The Model should not depend on the View or Controller, ensuring it remains independent of the user interface.


//Example of a simple Model in Swift:

struct Person {
    var name: String
    var age: Int
}


///#View:
///*The View is responsible for presenting the user interface to the user. It displays the data from the Model to the user and sends user input back to the Controller for processing. In Swift, Views are implemented using UIKit (for iOS/macOS/tvOS) or SwiftUI (for iOS/macOS/watchOS).
//Example of a simple View using SwiftUI:

import SwiftUI

struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var name = ""
    @State private var age = ""
    
    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            TextField("Name", text: $name)
            TextField("Age", text: $age)
            Text("Hello, \(name)! You are \(age) years old.")
        }
        .padding()
    }
}


///#Controller:
///*The Controller acts as an intermediary between the Model and View. It handles user interactions and updates the Model or View accordingly. In Swift, Controllers are typically implemented as classes or structs. They listen to user input from the View and update the Model or handle any necessary business logic.
//Example of a simple Controller in Swift:

import UIKit

class ViewController: UIViewController {
    @IBOutlet private var nameLabel: UILabel!
    @IBOutlet private var ageLabel: UILabel!
    @IBOutlet private var nameTextField: UITextField!
    @IBOutlet private var ageTextField: UITextField!
    
    @IBAction private func updateButtonTapped(_ sender: UIButton) {
        if let name = nameTextField.text, let ageStr = ageTextField.text, let age = Int(ageStr) {
            let person = Person(name: name, age: age)
            nameLabel.text = "Hello, \(person.name)!"
            ageLabel.text = "You are \(person.age) years old."
        }
    }
}

//In this example, the Controller listens to the "Update" button tap event and updates the labels with the entered name and age from the text fields.

///*MVC promotes the separation of concerns, making the codebase more organised and maintainable. It also allows for easy modification or extension of one component without affecting the others. Swift's support for MVC through UIKit (or SwiftUI) makes it an ideal choice for developing iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS applications.
