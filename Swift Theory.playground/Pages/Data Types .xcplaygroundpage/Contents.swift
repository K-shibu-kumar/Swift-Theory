// Basic Data Types
//Int
let myIntiger: Int = 123654774
/* Intiger is whole numbers which can be -1,0,+1... */

//Float
let myFloat: Float = 1.12345
/* Floating point number is 0.123,1.123,2.234.... which can add decimal places to whole number for accuracy*/

//Double
let MyDouble: Double = 9.837645
/* Double can hold more decimal places than Float to infinity ex: pi */

//Bool
let myBool: Bool = true
/* Boolean has only two possible values "true" or "false" */


// Strings
let myString: String = "This is a string data type"

// Arrays: - Array can hold a mix of all above data types.  Index value holds the data.

// Dictionary: - Key Value representation. Key is the name given to Data. Can hold a combination above data types. Like a Table spreadsheet

// Struct: - Which is actually like a blueprint contains properties and methods. Can handle and organise large amount of data

// Class: - Let's say this is an advanced Struct. Have all the features of a Struct and some.

//Optional data type: - All the above mentioned types can hold a .nil value. Optional data type handles the nil value data type.
