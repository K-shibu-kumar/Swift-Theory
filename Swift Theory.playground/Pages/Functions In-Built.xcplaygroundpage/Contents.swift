///# Built-In Functions



///*In Swift, the standard library provides a wide range of built-in functions that cover various operations, data types, and functionalities. Here are some commonly used built-in functions in Swift:

///# Arithmetic Functions:

///#  abs(_:)   : Returns the absolute value of a numeric value.
///#  min(_:_:) : Returns the minimum of two values.
///#  max(_:_:) : Returns the maximum of two values.
///#  ceil(_:)  : Rounds up to the nearest whole number.
///#  floor(_:) : Rounds down to the nearest whole number.
///#  round(_:) : Rounds to the nearest whole number.
///#  sqrt(_:)  : Returns the square root of a value.
///#  pow(_:_:) : Raises the first value to the power of the second value.


///#Collection Functions:

///# count(_:)     : Returns the number of elements in a collection.
///# isEmpty(_:)   : Checks if a collection is empty.
///# first(_:)     : Returns the first element of a collection.
///# last(_:)      : Returns the last element of a collection.
///# sorted(_:)    : Returns a sorted version of the collection.
///# filter(_:_:)  : Returns a new collection containing elements that satisfy a given condition.
///# map(_:_:)     : Transforms each element of a collection using a given closure and returns a new collection.
                        
                        
///# String Functions:
                        
///# count(_:)       : Returns the number of characters in a string.
///# isEmpty(_:)     : Checks if a string is empty.
///# hasPrefix(_:_:) : Checks if a string starts with a specific substring.
///# hasSuffix(_:_:) : Checks if a string ends with a specific substring.
///# uppercased(_:)  : Converts a string to uppercase.
///# lowercased(_:)  : Converts a string to lowercase.
///# split(_:_:)     : Splits a string into an array of substrings based on a delimiter.
                        
                        
///# Type Conversion Functions:
                        
///# Int(_:)        : Converts a value to an integer.
///# Double(_:)     : Converts a value to a double.
///# String(_:)     : Converts a value to a string.
                        
                        
///# Range Functions:
                        
///#  ..<    : Creates a half-open range that does not include the upper-bound value.
///#  ...    : Creates a closed range that includes both lower and upper bounds.
                        
                        
///# Assertion Functions:
                        
///# assert(_:_:)  : Checks the given condition during debugging and terminates the program if the condition is false.
                        
                        
///# Optional Handling Functions:
                        
///# Optional.some(_:)  : Wraps a value into an optional.
///# Optional.none      : Represents an optional with no value.


///*These are just a few examples of the built-in functions available in Swift. The Swift standard library offers a rich set of functions that facilitate various programming tasks, making Swift a powerful and expressive language for developing iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS applications.
