// TypeAlias

/*
 
 A type alias allows you to provide a new name for an existing data type into your program. After a type alias is declared, the aliased name can be used instead of the existing type throughout the program.

 Type alias do not create new types. They simply provide a new name to an existing type.

 The main purpose of typeAlias is to make our code more readable, and clearer in context for human understanding.

 We can combine more than one protocols in some cases using type alias : Decodable, Encodable = Codable
