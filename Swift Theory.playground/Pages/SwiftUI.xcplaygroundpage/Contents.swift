///# Ternary Operator


import SwiftUI
///*The ternary conditional operator (also known as the conditional operator) a ? b : c is used to return one of two values based on a condition. In SwiftUI, you can use the ternary operator to conditionally apply modifiers or display different views based on a condition.

//Here's an example of how you might use the ternary operator in SwiftUI:

struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var isToggled = false

    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Text("Hello, ")
            Text(isToggled ? "World!" : "SwiftUI!")
        }
        .padding()
        .background(isToggled ? Color.blue : Color.green)
        .foregroundColor(isToggled ? Color.white : Color.black)
        .onTapGesture {
            self.isToggled.toggle()
        }
    }
}

///*In this example, when isToggled is true, it will display "Hello, World!" in blue text with a green background. When isToggled is false, it will display "Hello, SwiftUI!" in black text with a blue background. When tapped, the onTapGesture toggles the value of isToggled.

///*Remember that the ternary operator is just one way to conditionally modify or display views in SwiftUI. Depending on your specific use case, you might also use if statements or switch statements to control the flow of your UI.
